Polymorphism :=====
===================
1. Polymorphism means that different types respond to the same function.
2. Polymorphism is based on the greek words Poly (many) and morphism (forms)
3. Polymorphism is the ability to leverage the same interface for different underlying forms such as data
types or classes. This permits functions to use entities of different types at different times.
4. Polymorphism is an important feature of class definition in Python that is utilized when you 
have commonly named methods across classes or subclasses. This allows functions to use objects of
any of these polymorphic classes without needing to be aware of distinctions across the classes.


Polymorphism with a function:
--------------------------------

class dog():
    def sound(self):
        print("bark")
class cat():
    def sound(self):
        print("meow")
def animal(animaltype):
    animaltype.sound()
obj1 = dog()
obj2 = cat()
animal(obj1)
animal(obj2)

#bark
#meow

Polymorphism with abstract class:
---------------------------------
1. If you create an editor you may not know in advance what type of documents a user will 
open (pdf format or word format?).  
2. To do so, we create an abstract class called document.
This class does not have any implementation but defines the structure (in form of functions) that all 
forms must have.   If we define the function show()  then both the PdfDocument and 
WordDocument must have the show() function

class Document:
    def __init__(self, name):    
        self.name = name
 
    def show(self):             
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")
class Pdf(Document):
    def show(self):
        return 'Show pdf contents!'
class Word(Document):
    def show(self):
        return 'Show word contents!'
documents = [Pdf('Document1'),
             Pdf('Document2'),
             Word('Document3')]
for document in documents:
    print document.name + ': ' + document.show()

output -->
Document1: Show pdf contents!
Document2: Show pdf contents!
Document3: Show word contents!
