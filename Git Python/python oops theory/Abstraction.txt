Abstraction:==================
==============================
1. Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods.
2. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation
3. Abstract classes may not be instantiated, and require subclasses to provide implementations for the abstract methods. 
4. Subclasses of an abstract class in Python are not required to implement abstract methods of the parent class.

class AbstractClass:
    
    def do_something(self):
        pass
class B(AbstractClass):
    pass
a = AbstractClass()
b = B()

Data abstraction --> refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding
the background details or implementation.
Data encapsulation --> is one of the fundamentals of OOP (object-oriented programming). It refers to the bundling of 
data with the methods that operate on that data. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a 
structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them.
