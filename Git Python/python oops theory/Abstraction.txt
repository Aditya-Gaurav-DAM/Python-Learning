Abstraction:==================
==============================
1. Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods.
2. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation

class AbstractClass:
    
    def do_something(self):
        pass
class B(AbstractClass):
    pass
a = AbstractClass()
b = B()

Data abstraction --> refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.
Data encapsulation --> is one of the fundamentals of OOP (object-oriented programming). It refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them.
