Abstraction:==================
==============================
1. Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods.
2. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation

class AbstractClass:
    
    def do_something(self):
        pass
class B(AbstractClass):
    pass
a = AbstractClass()
b = B()
