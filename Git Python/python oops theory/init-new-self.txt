========__init__================
================================
1. The __init__ function is called a constructor, or initializer, and is 
automatically called when you create a new instance of a class.
Within that function, the newly created object is assigned to the parameter self .
The notation self.legs is an attribute called legs of the object in the variable self
2. __init__ is called when ever an object of the class is constructed.
That means when ever we will create a student object we will see the message 
“A student object is created” in the prompt
3. All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
4. Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary 
to do when the object is being created

1. self represents the instance of the class. By using the "self" keyword we can access 
the attributes and methods of the class in python.


==>Use __new__ when you need to control the creation of a new instance. 
==>Use __init__ when you need to control initialization of a new instance.

==>__new__ is the first step of instance creation. 
It's called first, and is responsible for returning a new instance of your class. 
In contrast, __init__ doesn't return anything; it's only responsible for initializing the instance 
after it's been created.
