Python - Sorting Algorithms
============================
1. Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. 
Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order. 
Most common orders are in numerical or lexicographical order.

2. The importance of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level, 
if data is stored in a sorted manner. Sorting is also used to represent data in more readable formats. 
Below we see five such implementations of sorting in python.

3. Bubble sort is the one usually taught in introductory CS classes since it clearly demonstrates how sort 
works while being simple and easy to understand. Bubble sort steps through the list and compares adjacent pairs 
of elements. The elements are swapped if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the unsorted portion of the 
list is repeated until the list is sorted. Because Bubble sort repeatedly passes through the unsorted part of the 
list, it has a worst case complexity of O(nÂ²).

2. Merge Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Shell Sort
5. Selection Sort
