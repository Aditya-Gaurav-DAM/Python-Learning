==================================
1. Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type.
Most of the data structures make use of arrays to implement their algorithms.
==>Element- Each item stored in an array is called an element.
==>Index - Each location of an element in an array has a numerical index, which is used to identify the element.

2. Basic Operations
Traverse - print all the array elements one by one.
Insertion - Adds an element at the given index.
Deletion - Deletes an element at the given index.
Search - Searches an element using the given index or by the value.
Update - Updates an element at the given index.

3. Array is created in Python by importing array module to the python program.
from array import *
arrayName = array(typecode, [Initializers])

from array import *
array1 = array('i', [10,20,30,40,50])
for x in array1:
 print(x, end = " ")
#10 20 30 40 50    

4. Accessing Array Element:
We can access each element of an array using the index of the element.

from array import *
array1 = array('i', [10,20,30,40,50])
print (array1[0])
print (array1[2])
#10
#30

5. Insertion Operation:
Insert operation is to insert one or more data elements into an array.
Based on the requirement, a new element can be added at the beginning, end, or any given index of array.

from array import *
array1 = array('i', [10,20,30,40,50])
array1.insert(1,60)
for x in array1:
 print(x)
#10
#60
#20
#30
#40
#50


from array import *
array1 = array('i', [10,20,30,40,50])
array1.insert(-1,60) #(indexno,element to be added)
for x in array1:
 print(x)

#10
#20
#30
#40
#60
#50

6. Deletion Operation:
Deletion refers to removing an existing element from the array and re-organizing all elements of an array.

from array import *
array1 = array('i', [10,20,30,40,50])
array1.remove(40) #elements, not index no 
for x in array1:
 print(x)

#10
#20
#30
#50

7. Search Operation:
You can perform a search for an array element based on its value or its index

from array import *
array1 = array('i', [10,20,30,40,50])
print (array1.index(40)) #element
#3

8. Update Operation:
Update operation refers to updating an existing element from the array at a given index.

from array import *
array1 = array('i', [10,20,30,40,50])
array1[2] = 80
for x in array1:
 print(x)

#10
#20
#80
#40
#50
